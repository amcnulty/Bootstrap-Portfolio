                        Welcome to my basic portfolio page. I started this site to showcase some of my interests, hobbies, past-times or whatever else you may call them. In recent years I have been called a renaissance man. That is, a person with many talents. I love to learn and I also love to teach others what I have learned. Perhaps you can learn something by checking out my <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio Page</a>. If you have an questions be sure to <a href="contact.html">Contact Me</a>.

                        As I have already mentioned, I love to learn. All of my interests/talents started as a basic curiosity that I needed to learn more about. One thing I started early on was playing music. While watching a band play at church, I found myself captivated by the drummer. Before this time I had never really watched a band live before. I studied what the drummer was doing as the band was playing and told myself "I can do that!" Sure enough, one week later I asked a friend if I could play his drumset and I was already playing the same beat I saw performed.

                        My most recent interest that is worth talking about is cooking. It wasn't until only a year and a half ago that I started becoming very interested in cooking. I was never the cook in the house. Actually, I was the person who told everyone <i>I can't cook</i>. The dish that made me really start cooking a lot was yellow thai curry soup. I started ordering yellow curry at every restaurant that served it. I liked the stuff so much I just had to make it at home. I found all the ingredients and made everything from scratch. It was a long process but well worth it. Now, I enjoy cooking several dishes that I used to only order in restaurants and tinkering with the recipe.

                        There are many things that I enjoy doing. So many I don't want to talk about all of them right here. Enjoy checking out my portfolio! Also, I look forward to hearing from you!
